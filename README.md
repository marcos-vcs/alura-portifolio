#### Motivation
This project was created as part of Alura's HTML and CSS training track. My purpose in carrying out these studies is to further deepen my knowledge of these languages, seeking to fill gaps in my learning.

In this project I was able to improve my learning in HTML and CSS and better understand how the CSS flexbox feature works.
